Multi-platform_Application_Development

This Repo contains many projects and exercises generated during my IT studies.

The purpose of this repository is double, on the one hand make code public to the comunity to contribute and give the people to find examples of different strategies.

On the other hand, I hope this repo help to whom could be interested to know what have I exactly studied.
